    <h1>Beryl Kruger Resume</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>With over 20 years of experience in visual communication, including more than 10 years at a Senior Level and over 5 years in the iGaming sector, I bring a wealth of expertise to my role as a graphic designer.
        My work style is analytical and efficient, and I strive to deliver high-quality results on time. I prioritize and plan my work to ensure maximum productivity. As a friendly and inclusive team player, I enjoy sharing my skills and insights with others. I have a growth mindset and am eager to learn from constructive feedback to improve both my skills and character.
        My skill set is wide-ranging and includes design and layout for both digital and print media, illustration, photography, and motion graphics. I am highly proficient in industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I am also familiar with the basics of Adobe After Effects, Figma, Webflow, and Visual Studio Code.
        In addition to my design work, I also play a key role in managing my team’s day-to-day operations using JIRA. I mentor and train my colleagues on new program features and techniques to improve workflow, and I use Confluence to document essential information for the team’s reference.</p>
